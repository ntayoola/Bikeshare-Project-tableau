Tableau Bikeshare Project for General Assembly

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bikeshare data using Tableau to create visualizations and draw insights from the data. The project utilizes bikeshare data from two sources: the General Assembly server for the years 2017-2019 and publicly available data from Lyft Bay Wheels for the year 2023. It's important to note that the 2023 data only includes information up to the first week of June due to file size constraints.

Data Sources

General Assembly Server: Provides bikeshare data for the years 2017-2019, including trip information and station data.
Lyft Bay Wheels: Offers publicly available bikeshare data for the year 2023, enabling analysis of recent trends and patterns.

Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in creating visualizations using Tableau and deriving meaningful conclusions from the analysis of bikeshare data. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover insights into bikeshare usage patterns, popular routes, peak usage times, and more.

Key Features

Utilizes Tableau to visualize bikeshare data from multiple sources.
Integrates data from the General Assembly server and Lyft Bay Wheels for comprehensive analysis.
Provides insights and conclusions based on trends observed in the data.

Conclusion

Through this project, we demonstrate our ability to utilize Tableau for data visualization and analysis. By examining bikeshare data from different sources and time periods, we gain valuable insights into bikeshare usage patterns and trends, contributing to a better understanding of urban mobility dynamics.
